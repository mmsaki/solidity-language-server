## Agents

- User `jq` to analyze json outputs from ast.
- [poolmanager.json](./poolmanager.json) - ast generated by solc.

## Testing and Debugging

Always use `lsp-bench` as the first choice when you want to debug lsp methods and their output. The lsp-bench repo is https://github.com/mmsaki/lsp-bench (local clone path: `../lsp-bench`).

There are many examples on ./benchmarks on how to write a simple yaml config to you needs.

## Building

Always build with `--release` flag
