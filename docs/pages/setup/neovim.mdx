# Neovim

Example from your real setup in `~/.config/nvim/lsp`.

For the full settings schema, see [Setup Overview](/setup).

Server config:

```lua [.config/nvim/lsp/solidity-language-server.lua]
// [!include ~/snippets/setup/neovim.lua]
```

LSP capabilities + enable:

```lua [.config/nvim/plugin/lsp.lua]
// [!include ~/snippets/setup/neovim-plugin-lsp.lua]
```

## File manager requirement

For `templateOnCreate`, rename import updates, and delete import updates to work, your file manager must send LSP file operation events:

- `workspace/willCreateFiles`
- `workspace/willRenameFiles`
- `workspace/willDeleteFiles`

If these events are not sent, the server cannot apply those file-operation edits.

Example (`oil.nvim`):

```lua [.config/nvim/lua/plugins/oil.lua]
// [!include ~/snippets/setup/neovim-oil.lua]
```

## Neovim note for rename flows

After file renames, if your editor leaves updated imports in modified buffers, run:

```vim
:wa
```

This writes all modified buffers so tools reading from disk (for example `forge`) see updated imports.

## Debugging

Neovim LSP logs are written to:

```text
~/.local/state/nvim/lsp.log
```

Clear logs:

```bash
> ~/.local/state/nvim/lsp.log
```

Tail logs in real time:

```bash
tail -f ~/.local/state/nvim/lsp.log
```

Enable LSP log levels from Neovim:

```vim
" info level
:lua vim.lsp.set_log_level("info")
" trace/debug level
:lua vim.lsp.set_log_level("trace")
```

## Lint options reference

Lint options (severity, rule IDs, `only`, `exclude`) are documented in [Setup Overview → Lint values](/setup#lint-values).
