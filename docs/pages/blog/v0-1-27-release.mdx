# v0.1.27

Incremental Reindex Safety and Faster Cache Reuse

This release improves project-index reliability for large codebases by making incremental reindexing safer and cache reuse more predictable.

## What shipped

- New `projectIndex.incrementalEditReindexThreshold` setting (default `0.4`) to gate scoped reindex by affected-file ratio.
- Safer scoped reindex behavior:
  - scoped results are merged into the root cached build instead of replacing it,
  - declaration-id collision guardrails trigger full reindex fallback when unsafe.
- Project cache v2 lifecycle improvements:
  - warm-load reconcile for changed/affected files,
  - immediate per-save v2 upsert for touched files,
  - debounced single-flight sync during save bursts.

## Why this matters

- Reduces stale reference/goto windows after edits.
- Improves cache correctness under heavy save/refactor activity.
- Keeps startup behavior more predictable for large projects.

## Upgrade

```sh
cargo install solidity-language-server
```
