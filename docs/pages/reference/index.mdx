# Reference

These pages are implementation-deep technical notes for `solidity-language-server`.

They explain:

- how each LSP feature is implemented in practice,
- why certain design choices were made (including tradeoffs),
- known limitations and failure modes,
- and how Solc output + tree-sitter are combined in the request pipeline.

If you want behavior details beyond surface feature docs, start here.
