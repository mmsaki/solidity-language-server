# Solidity Language Server

## Why this server

`solidity-language-server` is built for large Solidity projects where correctness and responsiveness both matter.

- Instant, reliable code navigation in large Solidity codebases
- Low-latency editor feedback
- Broad, up-to-date language-server feature coverage
- Diagnostics and formatting for Foundry projects

The core objective is a language server that is reliable and performant by default: make go-to-definition/declaration effectively instant and correct, keep behavior consistent under real editor workflows, and maintain strong feature support as Solidity tooling evolves.
